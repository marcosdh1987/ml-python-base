# Codex UI Adapter

Use this repository-level structure as the canonical source of instructions.

## Level 1 — Governance

- `.github/architecture.md`
- `.github/standards.md`
- `.github/domain-boundaries.md`

## Level 2 — Operational Skills

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED SKILLS (managed by skills_sync; do not edit) -->
The governed skills below are projected into `.codex/skills/`. Internal skills are the source of truth and take precedence over external synced skills on name conflicts.

**Internal skills:**

- `brainstorm_quick` — Use for fast, lightweight ideation at the start of a feature — diverge on a few options, weigh trade-offs, converge on a recommendation. For the full design-gate workflow use the external `brainstorming` skill instead.
- `create_domain_contract` — Use when defining a typed domain contract — an application use case (business flow) or a repository interface (persistence boundary) — with clean architecture boundaries.
- `create_mle_agent_package` — Use when designing a reusable pip-installable MLE agent package with governed scaffolding, runtime adapters, and validation plans.
- `generate_e2e_tests` — Use when generating end-to-end tests for critical user, API, CLI, or service flows.
- `generate_implementation_docs` — Use when creating or updating implementation documentation for completed code or test changes.
- `generate_migration_plan` — Use when planning low-risk code, data, or architecture migrations with validation and rollback steps.
- `plan_and_execute_feature` — Use when delivering a feature through explicit planning, phased execution, validation, and governed handoff — or when implementing/fixing already-scoped engineering work via the execute_only mode.
- `refactor_to_clean_architecture` — Use when refactoring modules to align dependency direction, responsibilities, and boundaries with clean architecture.
- `research_current_info` — Use when the user asks for up-to-date or current information, to confirm something is still accurate, or when a task depends on facts that may have changed since training (library versions, APIs, pricing, releases, news, current best practices). Runs a governed web search with a curated domain allow/deny policy and cited, recency-checked results.
- `validate_module_structure` — Use when validating module placement, dependency direction, and structure against repository governance.

**External synced skills:**

- `brainstorming` — You MUST use this before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior. Explores user intent, requirements and design before implementation.
- `executing-plans` — Use when you have a written implementation plan to execute in a separate session with review checkpoints
- `finishing-a-development-branch` — Use when implementation is complete, all tests pass, and you need to decide how to integrate the work - guides completion of development work by presenting structured options for merge, PR, or cleanup
- `requesting-code-review` — Use when completing tasks, implementing major features, or before merging to verify work meets requirements
- `subagent-driven-development` — Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session
- `test-driven-development` — Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code
- `ui-ux-pro-max` — UI/UX design intelligence for web and mobile. Includes 50+ styles, 161 color palettes, 57 font pairings, 161 product types, 99 UX guidelines, and 25 chart types across 10 stacks (React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, SwiftUI, React Native, Flutter, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and HTML/CSS). Actions: plan, build, create, design, implement, review, fix, improve, optimize, enhance, refactor, and check UI/UX code. Projects: website, landing page, dashboard, admin panel, e-commerce, SaaS, portfolio, blog, and mobile app. Elements: button, modal, navbar, sidebar, card, table, form, and chart. Styles: glassmorphism, claymorphism, minimalism, brutalism, neumorphism, bento grid, dark mode, responsive, skeuomorphism, and flat design. Topics: color systems, accessibility, animation, layout, typography, font pairing, spacing, interaction states, shadow, and gradient. Integrations: shadcn/ui MCP for component search and examples.
- `using-git-worktrees` — Use when starting feature work that needs isolation from current workspace or before executing implementation plans - ensures an isolated workspace exists via native tools or git worktree fallback
- `writing-clearly-and-concisely` — Apply Strunk's timeless writing rules to ANY prose humans will read—documentation, commit messages, error messages, explanations, reports, or UI text. Makes your writing clearer, stronger, and more professional.
- `writing-plans` — Use when you have a spec or requirements for a multi-step task, before touching code

## Level 3 — Automation

- `.github/automation.md`

## Level 4 — Orchestration

- `.github/orchestration.md`

## Level 5 — Agents and SDLC

- `.github/agents/` — governed, tool-agnostic agent definitions.
- `.github/sdlc.md` — plan -> implement -> test -> document -> review, each gated by
  a `make` target.
- `.github/portability.md` — runtime/model tier abstraction and self-hosted fallback.

## Runtime Rules

- Use user language for interaction.
- Keep all code artifacts in English.
- Prefer Makefile and uv workflows.
