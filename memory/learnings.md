## Claude Code gateway model names must match native alias resolution — 2026-07-07

Claude Code reads the generated `.claude/agents/*.md` `model:` frontmatter for
subagents. To make gateway-routed Claude Code behave like direct Claude Code, use
Claude Code's native aliases in agent frontmatter (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`,
`fable`) and pin them with `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`,
`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`, and
`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL`. The gateway must expose the exact full model IDs
Claude Code resolves to (`claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-sonnet-5`,
`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, `claude-fable-5`). Nonstandard local aliases such as
`claude-opus-4.8-oauth` may work as legacy LiteLLM names, but they bypass Claude
Code's native alias/capability model and can produce misleading entitlement or
model-selection behavior.

## OpenCode gateway model ids mirror LiteLLM aliases — 2026-06-23

When LiteLLM exposes a model as `model_name: nim-*`, OpenCode should list the key
under `provider.gateway.models` without the provider prefix and select it as
`gateway/<model_name>` in `.env`. The NVIDIA API key stays in the gateway config;
the repo only needs `GATEWAY_BASE_URL` and `GATEWAY_TOKEN`.

## Antigravity skill manifest tracks generated ownership — 2026-06-29

`.agents/skills/.generated-manifest.tsv` is the skills_sync ownership list, not a
complete inventory of every local `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` directory. Runtime or
local-only skill dirs can sit beside generated skills; manifest/hash tests should
iterate manifest entries, not every local skill directory.

## How this template is wired for agents — 2026-06-22

The single source of truth for governance and skills lives in `.github/`; native
tool layouts (`.claude/`, `.opencode/`, `.agents/`, `.codex/`) are **generated** by
the `skills_sync` engine. Never hand-edit generated skill links or the region
between the `BEGIN/END GENERATED SKILLS` sentinels in adapter files — run
`make sync-skills` instead, and `make check-sync` to verify nothing is stale.

**Why it matters:** hand-edits to generated artifacts are silently overwritten and
break the CI drift gate.
**How to apply:** edit `.github/skills/*.md` (source) and regenerate.
