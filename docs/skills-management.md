# Skills Management

## Engine overview

Skill/adapter/agent projection is handled by a single declarative engine —
`src/ml_python_base/skills_sync` — driven by the registry at
`adapters/registry.toml`. **Adding a new AI tool is one `[[tool]]` entry** in that
registry (plus a Jinja2 template under `adapters/templates/`); no Makefile edit is
needed. The Makefile targets are thin wrappers:

| Target | Engine command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `make setup-claude-skills` | `link --tool claude` | Symlink native Claude skills |
| `make setup-opencode-skills` | `link --tool opencode` | Symlink native OpenCode skills |
| `make setup-antigravity-skills` | `link --tool antigravity` | Copy native Antigravity skills + manifest |
| `make render-adapters` | `render` | Regenerate the managed skill region in each adapter |
| `make sync-agents` | `agents` | Project governed agents into native formats |
| `make sync-skills` | `sync` | ingest + link + agents + render (one-shot) |
| `make check-sync` | `check` | Fail if any generated artifact is stale (CI gate) |
| `make purge-external-skills` | `purge` | Reset external skills + native views |

This project supports two skill sources:

- Internal/governed skills: `.github/skills/`
- External ad-hoc skills (installed by CLI tools): `.agents/skills/` (fallback: `.agent/skills/`)

Claude Code uses a generated native adapter layout for internal and synced external skills:

- `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

Antigravity uses a generated native workspace layout for the same governed skills:

- `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/rules/GEMINI.md`

Generate it from governed skills with:

```bash
make setup-claude-skills
make setup-antigravity-skills
```

The generated Claude files are symlinks back to `.github/skills/*.md` and `.github/skills-external/<skill-name>/`. The generated Antigravity files are copied into `.agents/skills/` together with a hidden manifest used to distinguish governed output from newly installed ad-hoc skills. Governed folders remain the source of truth.

Default internal skills bundled by template:

- `create_domain_contract`
- `create_mle_agent_package`
- `generate_e2e_tests`
- `generate_implementation_docs`
- `refactor_to_clean_architecture`
- `validate_module_structure`
- `generate_migration_plan`
- `plan_and_execute_feature`

## Sync external skills to governed layout

Use:

```bash
make sync-skills
```

Example external install before sync:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/wshobson/agents --skill langchain-architecture
```

What it does:

1. Detects external source in this order:
   - `.agents/skills/`
   - `.agent/skills/`
2. Copies each valid skill directory (`SKILL.md` plus any supporting files) to:
   - `.github/skills-external/<skill-name>/`
3. Skips invalid folders without `SKILL.md`
4. Keeps existing `.github/skills-external/` entries unless explicitly purged
5. Regenerates a governed `skills-lock.json` from synced skills (hash + timestamp)
6. Cleans installer artifacts after sync:
   - removes `.agent/skills/`
7. Refreshes `.claude/skills/`, `.opencode/skills/`, and `.agents/skills/` so Claude
   Code, OpenCode, and Antigravity discover internal and external skills natively
8. Regenerates the managed skill region inside every adapter file (`CLAUDE.md`,
   `OPENCODE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`,
   `.agents/rules/GEMINI.md`) so the skill lists never drift
9. Projects governed agents (`.github/agents/`) into `.claude/agents/` (markdown),
   `.opencode/agents/` (markdown + `permission` map), and `.codex/agents/` (TOML)

## Adapter skill regions and the drift gate

Each adapter file carries a machine-managed block between sentinels:

```
<!-- BEGIN GENERATED SKILLS (managed by skills_sync; do not edit) -->
...generated skill list...
<!-- END GENERATED SKILLS -->
```

Only that block is generated; the surrounding governance prose stays hand-written.
`make check-sync` (run in CI) fails if any adapter region, native view, manifest,
lock file, or projected agent is stale relative to the governed sources — so the
lists can never silently drift. Fix drift with `make sync-skills`.

## Safety behavior

- If no external source exists, command exits successfully (`0`) without failing CI.
- If source exists but has no skill folders, command exits successfully.
- If a skill folder is malformed, it is skipped and reported.
- `skills-lock.json` is always refreshed from `.github/skills-external/`.
- Generated Antigravity skills are skipped on re-sync by comparing against `.agents/skills/.generated-manifest.tsv`.
- Cleanup only removes legacy `.agent/skills/`; `.agents/skills/` is now preserved as native Antigravity output.

## Recommended workflow

1. Keep internal curated skills in `.github/skills/`.
2. Run `make setup-claude-skills` after internal skill changes so Claude Code can discover them natively.
3. Run `make setup-antigravity-skills` after internal skill changes so Antigravity can discover them natively.
4. Install/update external skills via your CLI tool (for example `npx skills ...`).
5. Run `make sync-skills` to normalize external vendor skills into `.github/skills-external/` and refresh both `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`.

## Purge external skills (reset template)

Use:

```bash
make purge-external-skills
```

What it does:

1. Removes all synced external skills from `.github/skills-external/`
2. Removes temporary legacy installer folders (`.agent/skills/`) and resets generated `.agents/skills/`
3. Removes governed lock metadata (`skills-lock.json`)
4. Recreates `.github/skills-external/` as an empty folder
5. Refreshes `.claude/skills/` so external native links are removed
6. Refreshes `.agents/skills/` so only governed internal skills remain available to Antigravity
