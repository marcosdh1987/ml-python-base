# Copilot Instructions (Template Governance Adapter)

Use the following 4-level structure as the single source of truth:

## Level 1 — Governance

- `.github/architecture.md`
- `.github/standards.md`
- `.github/domain-boundaries.md`

Always read and apply these files before generating code or plans.

## Level 2 — Operational Skills

Internal governed skills are the source of truth:

- `.github/skills/` (internal curated)
- `.github/skills-external/` (synced external/vendor)

Prefer internal curated skills when both define overlapping capabilities.

Claude Code has a generated native view at `.claude/skills/`, Antigravity has a generated native view at `.agents/skills/`, and OpenCode has a generated native view at `.opencode/skills/`. All three are refreshed with `make sync-skills`; each can also be refreshed individually with `make setup-claude-skills`, `make setup-antigravity-skills`, or `make setup-opencode-skills`. Copilot should continue to use `.github/skills/` and `.github/skills-external/` as inline instruction references.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED SKILLS (managed by skills_sync; do not edit) -->
Read the governed skills below directly from `.github/skills/` (internal) and `.github/skills-external/` (external). Internal skills take precedence over external synced skills on name conflicts.

**Internal skills:**

- `create_domain_contract` — Use when defining a typed domain contract — an application use case (business flow) or a repository interface (persistence boundary) — with clean architecture boundaries.
- `create_mle_agent_package` — Use when designing a reusable pip-installable MLE agent package with governed scaffolding, runtime adapters, and validation plans.
- `generate_e2e_tests` — Use when generating end-to-end tests for critical user, API, CLI, or service flows.
- `generate_implementation_docs` — Use when creating or updating implementation documentation for completed code or test changes.
- `generate_migration_plan` — Use when planning low-risk code, data, or architecture migrations with validation and rollback steps.
- `plan_and_execute_feature` — Use when delivering a feature through explicit planning, phased execution, validation, and governed handoff — or when implementing/fixing already-scoped engineering work via the execute_only mode.
- `refactor_to_clean_architecture` — Use when refactoring modules to align dependency direction, responsibilities, and boundaries with clean architecture.
- `validate_module_structure` — Use when validating module placement, dependency direction, and structure against repository governance.

**External synced skills:**

- `ui-ux-pro-max` — UI/UX design intelligence for web and mobile. Includes 50+ styles, 161 color palettes, 57 font pairings, 161 product types, 99 UX guidelines, and 25 chart types across 10 stacks (React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, SwiftUI, React Native, Flutter, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and HTML/CSS). Actions: plan, build, create, design, implement, review, fix, improve, optimize, enhance, refactor, and check UI/UX code. Projects: website, landing page, dashboard, admin panel, e-commerce, SaaS, portfolio, blog, and mobile app. Elements: button, modal, navbar, sidebar, card, table, form, and chart. Styles: glassmorphism, claymorphism, minimalism, brutalism, neumorphism, bento grid, dark mode, responsive, skeuomorphism, and flat design. Topics: color systems, accessibility, animation, layout, typography, font pairing, spacing, interaction states, shadow, and gradient. Integrations: shadcn/ui MCP for component search and examples.

Refresh this layout with `make sync-skills` (or `make check-sync` to verify it is current).
<!-- END GENERATED SKILLS -->

Each skill must:

- receive explicit input,
- produce structured output,
- comply with governance files.

## Level 3 — Real Automation

Prefer system-enforced quality over model-only behavior:

- strict lint rules
- CI checks
- structure enforcement
- PR bots

Automation policy reference:

- `.github/automation.md`

## Level 4 — Orchestration

Use explicit orchestration for complex tasks:

- plan-first requirement
- step-by-step execution
- mandatory diff review
- validation against automation
- no direct large generation without relevant skill invocation

Orchestration policy reference:

- `.github/orchestration.md`

## Level 5 — Agents and SDLC

- `.github/agents/` — governed, tool-agnostic agent definitions.
- `.github/sdlc.md` — lifecycle phases gated by `make` targets.
- `.github/portability.md` — model tier abstraction and self-hosted fallback design.

## Additional Rules

- Interact with user in the language used by the user.
- Keep all code artifacts in English.
- Prefer `Makefile` commands and `uv` workflow.
- When implementing and testing new changes, create or update documentation in `docs/`.
