# Skills Catalog

Operational skills must receive explicit input and return structured output.

Each internal skill file must include YAML frontmatter with:

- `name`: file name without `.md`
- `description`: semantic trigger description for native skill discovery

## Skill Sources

- Internal curated skills: `.github/skills/`
- External synced skills: `.github/skills-external/`
- Claude Code native generated links: `.claude/skills/`
- Antigravity native generated copies: `.agents/skills/`
- OpenCode native generated links: `.opencode/skills/`

Precedence rule:

- If a skill exists in both places, prefer `.github/skills/`.

Refresh all native adapter views after internal or external skill changes:

```bash
make sync-skills
```

Or refresh individually:

```bash
make setup-claude-skills
make setup-antigravity-skills
make setup-opencode-skills
```
